The CLI communicates with InfluxDB directly by making requests to the InfluxDB API over port 8086 by default.

To run influx - run influxd.exe
run cli - influx.exe

Commands:

CREATE DATABASE mydb
SHOW DATABASES
USE mydb
INSERT measurement,field1=serverA,field2=us_west value=0.64
SELECT field1, fiels2, "value" FROM measurement

Conceptually you can think of a measurement as an SQL table, 
where the primary index is always time. tags and fields are effectively columns in the table. 
tags are indexed, and fields are not. 
The difference is that, with InfluxDB, you can have millions of measurements, 
you don’t have to define schemas up-front, and null values aren’t stored.

When no timestamp is supplied for a point, InfluxDB   the local current timestamp when the point is ingested.
