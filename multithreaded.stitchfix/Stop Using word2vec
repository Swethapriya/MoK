Word vectors are awesome but you don’t need a neural network – and definitely don’t need deep learning – to find them2.
Stop using word2vec just use

Pointwise Mutual Information(PMI) = log(skipgram_prob(a,b)/unigram_prob(a)unigram_prob(b))
where skipgram_prob = probability of a,b occuring together
	  unigram_prob  = probability of occurance of word

PMI Matrix - x,y - words values are PMI
singular value decomposition (SVD):
	provides another way to factorize a matrix, into singular vectors and singular values.
	Each row of one matrix represents a single word vector.
