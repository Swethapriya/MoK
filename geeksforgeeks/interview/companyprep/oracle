Kadane's Algorithm:
	Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.

	Algorithm:
		Initialize:
		max_so_far = 0
		max_ending_here = 0

		Loop for each element of the array
		  (a) max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]
		  (b) if(max_ending_here < 0)
					max_ending_here = 0
		  (c) if(max_so_far < max_ending_here)
					max_so_far = max_ending_here
		return max_so_far

Sorting Cyclic Linked list in place:
	find length of cycle using 2 pointers with different speeds:
		Let the pointers meet and then fix one pointer and let the other pointer meet it again. 
	find lenght of linked list:
		Two pointers lenght of cycle apart, one step at a time both pointers till they are equal. 
		gives the index of starting of cycle. 
	Sort using bubble sort only till the length

Diameter of Binary Search Tree:
	The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree

	Diameter of a tree can be calculated by only using the height function, 
	because the diameter of a tree is nothing but maximum value of (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node. 
	So we need to calculate this value (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node and update the result. 
	Time complexity – O(n)
